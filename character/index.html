                Mario is the protagonist and main character in Nintendo and
                Illumination Entertainment’s new film, The Super Mario Bros
                Movie. He is a beloved icon who is known for his trademark red
                hat adorned with his first initial. Although he is a skilled
                plumber, Mario’s true calling is being a hero. He is always
                ready for adventure and travels across Mushroom Kingdom time
                after time to save his friends from danger. In The Super Mario
                Bros. Movie, Mario is shown to be brave and determined as he
                embarks on a perilous journey across Mushroom Kingdom with
                Princess Peach to save the world from evil Bowser.

                Princess Peach, also known as Princess Peach Toadstool or just
                Peach, is one of the most recognisable characters in The Super
                Mario Bros. Movie. As her title may suggest, she rules over
                Mushroom Kingdom and lives in Castle Toadstool with her loyal
                helper, Toad. Although royalty comes with many privileges,
                Princess Peach often finds herself in trouble because of her
                position as ruler. She is often kidnapped by Bowser, the evil
                antagonist who wants to take over her kingdom. This time though,
                it is Luigi who has been kidnapped and Peach joins Mario and
                Toad on their quest to stop Bowser and save the world.

                    One of the smallest but most significant characters in The
                    Super Mario Bros. Movie is Toad. He is an adorable, cheerful
                    mushroom and loyal friend to Princess Peach. Although tiny,
                    Toad doesn’t let his size stop him. He is a brave character
                    who will stand up for those he cares about and isn’t afraid
                    to fight for what’s right. He plays a main part in The Super
                    Mario Bros. Movie as he teams up with Mario and Peach to
                    save Mushroom Kingdom from Bowser’s control.

                    Bowser, also known as King Koopa, is the main antagonist and
                    one of the leading characters in The Super Mario Bros.
                    Movie. He is a giant anthropomorphic turtle with sharp teeth
                    and a spiked shell. Bowser also has extremely sharp claws
                    and breathes fire. In other words, you don’t want to mess
                    with him. He is the power-hungry ruler of an army of loyal
                    henchmen, including Goombas and Koopa Troopas, who he uses
                    to help him achieve his goal of taking over Mushroom
                    Kingdom. He is also the father of seven Koopalings. In The
                    Super Mario Bros. Movie, Bowser is yet again trying to take
                    over the world and make Princess Peach his queen using the
                    Power Star. Otherwise, he threatens to use the Star to
                    destroy her kingdom.

                  <dd>
                    Voiced by Charlie Day, Luigi plays a large role in The Super
                    Mario Bros. Movie. He is the younger brother of Mario and is
                    known for his iconic green hat. In the film, he is also seen
                    wearing a matching green collared shirt beneath his
                    signature denim overalls. Like his brother, Luigi grew up in
                    Mushroom Kingdom and became a plumber. Although shown to be
                    more cowardly than Mario, he fights evil alongside his
                    brother being brave when it counts and is incredibly loyal
                    to his friends. In The Super Mario Bros. Movie, we see Luigi
                    get separated from his brother as he is kidnapped by Bowser.
                    Will Mario and Princess Peach be able to save him?

                    Donkey Kong (DK) is a semi-friendly, giant gorilla who is a
                    key character in The Super Mario Bros. Movie. He is the
                    Prince of Jungle Kingdom where he lives alongside other
                    members of his species. Unsurprisingly, he loves bananas and
                    you might find an array of slippery skins lying around his
                    kingdom. The popularity of Donkey Kong has also led to the
                    creation of a whole family of new characters including his
                    nephew, Diddy Kong, and his arch-nemesis, King K. Rool.
                    Although DK has been Mario’s main antagonist in Super Mario
                    Bros. video games in the past, he is now a friendly rival of
                    the plumber.
